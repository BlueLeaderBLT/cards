I think that doing war would be one of the easiest and interesting games. Since the computer can literally figure
out the enitre game within seconds. Also, after were done programming 
the game we can run tests like Mr. Soistmann was saying to see
if there are any way to know if you are going to win because I think that would be very interesting.
If you have anything to add or say just add it to this document.
